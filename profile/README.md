## Enforce DevOps best practices

Warestack is a developer tool that ensures your team consistently follows best practices across the DevOps lifecycle. By automating critical checks, flagging missed steps, and stopping workflows when critical conditions are unmet, Warestack prevents deployment errors before they reach production. It bridges operational gaps, reduces lead times from hours to minutes, and empowers teams to deliver consistent and reliable deployments.

### The problems

- Teams face delays in releases due to a lack of visibility into code changes and workflow errors, making it difficult to promptly identify and resolve issues. 
- Development lifecycles are inconsistent and prone to errors without standardized processes and effective workflow strategies, resulting in inefficiency and quality issues. 
- Teams struggle with tracking productivity and ensuring continuous improvement when documentation is insufficient and processes lack transparency, hindering optimization and accountability.

### Our solution

- Identify and resolve release delays instantly. Gain visibility into operational tasks triggered by code changes with a live feed of team activities. Monitor workflow runs with actionable insights and resolve issues quickly with step-by-step guidance.
- Enhance development lifecycles with best practices. Standardize releases with pull request-based deployments. Use maintainable composite workflow steps and enforce proper branching and workflow strategies, complete with granular permissions and review processes.
- Track team productivity and drive continuous improvement. Collaborate with full accountability by documenting every process in detail for transparency and ongoing optimization. Govern team productivity and streamline release cycles effectively.
