# Warestack

## Set up your custom release protection for each teamâ€™s needs

Warestack uses Agentic AI and natural language automation to detect and block risky deployments, enforce protection rules, and align DevOps across version control tools like GitHub and project management tools like Slack and Linear.

Today's development tools often operate in silos. Skipped reviews, deployment failures, and overlooked issues can still result in Linear tickets being marked as "Done", leading to unpredictable production errors.

Warestack fills these operational gaps by connecting and standardizing steps across the toolchain:

- Detecting issues beforehand: Flags skipped checks, risky merges, and unreviewed changes before they impact production.
- Enforcing toolchain rules: Blocks workflows when conditions aren't met, ensuring every step is accountable.
- Standardizing deployments: Enforces processes to guarantee consistent, error-free releases.

Like that, Warestack reduces lead times from hours to minutes and ensures consistent, reliable deployments - transforming your team's fragmented workflows into streamlined, predictable pipelines.
